# Project Overview

## Introduction

This repository contains an evaluation project designed to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of various technologies in web development. The primary focus of this project is to assess different frameworks and libraries for both backend and frontend development.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: 
  - `Spring Boot`: Utilized for creating the backend API, offering robust, enterprise-level functionality.

- **Frontend**: 
  - `React`: Implemented for one version of the frontend to evaluate its component-based architecture and ecosystem.
  - `Angular`: Used in a separate frontend instance to assess its comprehensive framework capabilities, including dependency injection and dynamic data binding.

## Project Status

Please note that this project is purely for evaluation purposes. It is not intended for production use and lacks certain critical features:

- **Security**: No advanced security measures have been implemented.
- **Production Optimization**: The project has not been optimized for production environments. It serves as a demonstration of basic functionalities and framework capabilities.
